                        OCamlWinTop

DESCRIPTION

This is a simplistic user interface for the OCaml toplevel under MS
Windows.  It provides a text window with basic editing facilities,
allowing users to enter OCaml toplevel phrases and see the responses
of the toplevel.

STATUS

This code used to be part of the OCaml core distribution from INRIA.
It never worked well and had few users.  It was pulled out of
the core distribution in 2012 and turned into this independent project.
This code hasn't been maintained since then and should be considered
as abandoned.
